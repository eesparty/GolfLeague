<p class="Bold_Header">2.0 Rules Committee</p>
<p>The       Rules committee will handle all league disputes fairly.&nbsp; Their judgment is final.&nbsp; The committee will consist of 2 people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="Bold_Header">3.0 Course</p>
        <p><br>
          Fellows Creek<br>
 2936 S  Lotz Rd<br>
 Canton,  MI<br>
734-728-1300</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fellowscreekgolf.com/">https://www.fellowscreekgolf.com/</a></p>
<p class="Bold_Header">4.0 Tee Box</p>
<p>Fellows Creek has 4 sets of  tees.&nbsp; The League will play from the  White Tees.&nbsp; Those players who are 65 and  older before Week 1 may play from the Yellow Tees.&nbsp; Once the league has started a player may not  change the Tees they play from.</p>
<p>Exceptions:</p>
<p>Since the yardage disparity is rather large:<br>
  All players will play the Yellow  Tees on the East Course Hole #7 Par 3<br>
  All players will play the Yellow  Tees on the West Course Hole #4 Par 3</p>
<p class="Bold_Header">5.0 Handicap</p>
<p>Returning player&rsquo;s initial handicap  will be 90% of the average of all scores from the previous year rounded to the  nearest 1.&nbsp; This handicap will be used  until a new handicap is established after 3 weeks of play.</p>
<p>After a player has played 3 weeks a  new handicap will be established using 90% of the average of the 3 scores  rounded to the nearest 1.&nbsp; All new  players will use this handicap for weeks 1 thru 4.</p>
<p>After a player has played 4 weeks  the handicap will be calculated as 90% of the average of the 4 scores rounded  to the nearest 1.</p>
<p>After a player has played 5 weeks  the handicap will be calculated using 90% of the average of 3 scores rounded to  the nearest 1 after the best and worst score are dropped from the previous 5  scores.&nbsp; Each following week&rsquo;s handicaps  will be established using the previous 5 weeks in this manner. </p>
<p>The maximum handicap for the League  is 18</p>
<p>Makeup rounds will be used in the  handicap calculation in the order of the week being made up</p>
<p>Example: If a player's scores are 41,  48, 45, 46, and 42 and par for each week is 36, the player&rsquo;s<br>
  handicap would drop the 41 and 48  and use 45+46+42 / 3 = 44.33 &ndash; 36 (par) = 8.33 * 90% &nbsp;= 7.4, rounded = 7.</p>
<p class="Bold_Header">6.0 Stats</p>
<p class="Bold_Header"><span class="Bold_Sub">6.1 Strokes</span> <span class="Bold_Sub">and Putts</span></p>
<p>Each player will count the total  strokes for each hole and each putt for a hole.&nbsp;  A putt from a surface other than the green (fringe, fairwary,etc.) is  not counted as a putt.&nbsp; With these  records we can track Putts, Greens in Regulation, Eagles, Birdies, Par, etc.</p>
<p class="Bold_Header"><span class="Bold_Sub">6.1 Putting Out</span></p>
<p>Every hole must be putted out (No  &lsquo;gimmies&rsquo; shall be given).&nbsp; If a hole is  not putted in the player will receive the maximum double par for the hole.&nbsp; This is done since we play everyone, not just  our foursome and everyone is not there to give consent.</p>
<p class="Bold_Header">7.0 Scoring</p>
<p class="Bold_Header"><span class="Bold_Sub">7.1 General Scoring</span></p>
<p>After each weekly score is calculated  using the player's handicap, each player will receive 2 points for every other player  beaten and 1 point for every other player tied.&nbsp;  If a player is absent and the week is not made up, that player will  receive the highest score of the week + 1 stroke and will receive 0  points.&nbsp; If more than 1 player is absent,  those players will receive points for a tie with each other.&nbsp; The highest 6 point totals at the end of the  year wins the prize money.&nbsp; This type of  scoring keeps everyone in the race even if a player misses a week.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the event of a tie in the top 6  spots the payout will be the total prize for the spots that are tied divided by  the number of players tied.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Example: If 2 players are tied for  2nd they are considered the 2nd and 3rd place  winners will split the 2nd and 3rd place combined payouts.</p>
<p class="Bold_Sub"><span class="Bold_Sub">7.2 Number of Weeks</span></p>
<p>15 Weeks will be used for the  scoring (5 rounds per course).&nbsp; The 16th  week will be a non-scoring week and all prizes will be handed out </p>
<p class="Bold_Header">8.0 Low Net Score</p>
<p>A payout of $80 will be given for  the lowest total Net score on each course (South, East, West).&nbsp; The Net score will be calculated using total  scores for all rounds played on the course minus that player&rsquo;s handicap for  each round.&nbsp; All rounds must be played  during regular league play so no makeup rounds will be used.&nbsp; If no player has played all 5 rounds on a  particular course the payout will go to the best Net score for 4 rounds and so  on.</p>
<p class="Bold_Sub"><span class="Bold_Header">9.0&nbsp;Golfer of the Week Payout</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Each week the player with the lowest  score with handicap will receive $25 (based on 24 players).&nbsp; The winner must be present for regular league  play (makeup rounds are not eligible).&nbsp;  In the event of a Tie, the money will be split evenly.</p>
<p class="Bold_Header">10.0 Makeups ans Subs</p>
<p>- Makeups </p>
<ul>
  <li>Each player is financially responsible for their  makeup round. &nbsp;A witness (preferably  another league member) must play and sign the score card before it is turned  in.&nbsp; The receipt is also required along  with the scorecard</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If a week is going to be missed a makeup can be  played before hand as long as the round is declared a makeup for the specific  date to be missed.&nbsp; In the event of a  cancelation for the missed week the makeup round will be null and void. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If a week is missed and a makeup round has not  yet been played, the round can only be made up before the next week of  play.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>There are no makeups for the final scoring week,  players must play during scheduled league time to get credit for their round.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Out of order makeup rounds are not allowed.&nbsp; If a week is missed and it's not made up before  the following week of league play the player will not be allowed to make it  up.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>All scores/receipts for makeup rounds must be  reported before the following week of league play or the score will not be  counted.</li>
</ul>
<p>- Subs</p>
<p>If there is an opening because of  an absence a sub can golf in the available slot.&nbsp; The sub will pay the league $10 and have the  option to rent a cart.&nbsp; Sub scores do not  count towards the league and subs are not required if there are weekly  openings.&nbsp; Subs are just a way to build  the fund for the Golfer of the Week payout.</p>
<p class="Bold_Header">11.0 Closest to the Pin (Optional)</p>
<p>A weekly Closest to the Pin will be  combined with a Year Closest to the Pin.&nbsp;  The entry fee is $60 which is $1 per hole weekly (2 holes/course) and $5  each for 6 holes in the Year game.&nbsp; Each  closest shot will win the weekly payout and be measured to the inch and logged  by the last group.&nbsp; If a week has no  winner, the payout will carry over to the next time that hole is played.&nbsp; If there are no winners the final week, the  payout will be distributed equally among the players.&nbsp; The weekly payouts for each hole will be $1 x  No. Players.&nbsp; The shortest distance to  each hole at the end of the season will receive a year payout of $5 x No.  Players.&nbsp; The winner must be present for  regular league play (makeup rounds are not eligible).&nbsp; There will be no closest to the pin for the  non-scoring week.</p>
<p>Note: All players will play the  Yellow Tees on the East Course Hole #7 and the West Course #4</p>
<p class="Bold_Header">12.0 Schedule</p>
<p>The League starts on Tuesday, April  30 and we will play 16 weeks</p>
